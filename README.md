# Poverty link to early death 'scandalous'

![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/14ABA/production/_102566648_gerardcomposite.jpg)

In July 2018 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-44853482) people living in the poorest parts of the UK were more likely to die prematurely.

Our analysis revealed the mortality rate from avoidable causes was more than three times higher in some of the most deprived parts of the country than the most affluent. 

We found a strong correlation between deprivation and the number of people dying prematurely.
